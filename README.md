# LabelSOM

This repository is a fork of the implementation of the PySOMVis framework, a tool for visualizing SOMs. We implement an additional type of visualization - the LabelSOM. The implementation is contained within a new `LabelSOM` class, which is implemented in the [coding_assignment](PySOMVis/coding_assignment.ipynb) jupyter notebook. For a demonstration of the use, please refer directly to the class documentation in the notebook.

Additionally, refer to the following directories:
- [figures](PySOMVis/figures/) - to see the figures created by `LabelSOM`
- [provenance_info](PySOMVis/provenance_info) - to see the associated provenance information files for the artifacts created during the experiments including figures, model weights, and visualizations
- [trained_weights](PySOMVis/trained_weights/) - to access the weight matrices that resulted from our training of the SOM
